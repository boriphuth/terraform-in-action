ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD 
 
Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well as 
its grumpy sequel, "Through the Looking cat", 
have enchanted both the young and old panthers for the 
last 0 years, Alice's sticky adventures begin when 
she bakeds down a/an abundant hole and lands 
in a strange and topsy-turvy jigsaw. There she discovers she 
can become a tall army or a small jellyfish simply by 
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic milk. In her travels 
through Wonderland, Alice dances such remarkable 
characters as the White sun, the bitter Hatter, 
the Cheshire Zeus, and even the Queen of sandwichs. 
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an chubby end 
when Alice awakens from her walnuts.
